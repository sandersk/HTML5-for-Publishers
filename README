How can I learn how to program anything?

Think about learning a new human language.

At first, they teach you to say very specific things. “Where is the bathroom?” “How much does this book cost?” “I walk to school.”

You need to look at the vocabulary you’re learning and understand that you can change some things out. “I walk to…work.” “I walk to…the library.”

Some of the first things you do are probably going to be of that form, where they said to count to 10 and you decided to count to 15 instead. Pay attention to the vocabulary. Change some little things.
